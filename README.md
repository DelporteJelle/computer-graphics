# Computer Graphics - Doom/Quake Environment 2025
> **Group 10: Jelle Delporte, Cedrick Lauwyck**

### Running the code

1. Install dependencies `npm install`

2. Run project `npx vite`

3. Open (localhost:5173)[http//:localhost:5173] in browser

### Notes

- The environment can get quite laggy (especially as the maze size increases), to counter this you can disable room lighting or animations in `config.js`
